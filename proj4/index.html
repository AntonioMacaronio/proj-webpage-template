  <p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>

  <p>In this project, we created a cloth simulation based on springs and pointmasses, and styled them with various shaders. The simulation is based off a 2D grid of springs and pointmasses which apply forces on different sections of the cloth through Hooke’s Law, and calculates the next frames with Verlet Integration. There was also a self-collision implementation to have the cloth not pass through itself, and the shaders were implemented by using various models of light calculation from lecture, such as Blinn-Phong, Mirror, and Texture Mapping.</p>

  <table style="width:100%">
    <tr align="center">
      <td>

    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>

  With a low ks value such as 100 N/m, the cloth looks very saggy - it seems to be much more ‘stretchable’ and more ‘malleable’ in the sense that the middle section has more crease from gravity pulling down on the main part of cloth. The cloth appears to hold itself not as rigidly as the one with 5000 N/m.

  With a higher ks value, such as ks = 50000 N/m, the cloth appears to be more taut and more uniform towards the bottom (no curling at the corners). Notice at the top of the cloth, it does not sag as deeply as it seems the cloth holds itself together more rigidly. Likewise, there are not as many creases from the hanging which leads to an overall more uniform colored appearance.
</p>


<blockquote><b>

    What about for <code>density</code>?

<div align="middle">

      <td>

        <figcaption>low density (1.5 g/cm^2)</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
  When the density of the cloth is increased, the cloth sags much more heavily. The example below shows an image of the cloth with density = 150g/cm^2 and the dip in the middle really stretches the cloth to its limit. There are many visible creases at the top and towards the bottom, the corners’ curling curvature to balance out the unevenness of the crease becomes quite apparent because the cloth is so heavy.

  When the density of the cloth is decreased, the cloth doesn’t sag much at all and the simulation makes it appear much ‘lighter’. The crease is much less visible and towards the bottom, there is almost no curling at the corners and the color is much more uniform as a result of this increased evenness. In the following picture, the cloth is depicted with a density of 1.5g/cm^2.

<blockquote><b>
  <small>
    What about for <code>damping</code>?

<div align="middle">
  <table style="width:100%">

        <figcaption>high damping</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>
  When the damping constant is very low, the cloth oscillates a lot when falling and takes a long time to come to a stable, still position. It has a lot of vibration in it that takes a while to settle, which gives the surface an undulating, wavy appearance and it’s not as smooth or even during the falling motion. Here, the damping factor was set to ~0.07, and the image shows that the fabric falls fast to a point where the bottom of the fabric is behind the two pinned points and oscillates back and forth for a while like a pendulum would.

  When the damping constant is high, the cloth falls slowly and there is almost no unevenness in the fabric. Since it falls slowly, the fabric never falls behind the two pinned points and doesn’t oscillate like it did with a low damping constant; additionally, the surface of the cloth is much more uniform. Here, the damping factor was set to 0.54.

<blockquote><b>
  <small>Describe the differences in the results.</small>
</b></blockquote>

<p>
  The cloth’s appearance as it rests on the sphere changes depending on its ks value very intuitively to its behavior in task 2. Earlier, we described that with a higher ks value, the cloth is more rigid and appears more ‘taut’ in how it bends and folds. This can be seen as the cloth with the highest ks value of 50,000 N/m doesn’t bend around the ball and sag as much as the others. Conversely, the cloth with a ks value of 500 N/m appears much more soft and sags greatly, which allows it to wrap around the ball much more and the corners droop straight down in the direction of gravity; additionally, there are much more wrinkles and creases has the cloth warps to the shape of the underlying sphere. The cloth with a ks value of 5000 N/m is somewhat in between these two, having somewhat droopy corners but also more rigidity and tightness in its texture.

<p>
  Increased density seems to be making the cloth more flattened and close to the ground, while a decreased density seems to be making the force pushing the cloth away from itself a bit more prevalent. This makes sense intuitively because with increased density, a cloth becomes heavier, and thus, it flattens itself out more because it weighs more onto itself, and a decreased density means that the cloth is lighter, so the spring forces within can exert more acceleration, leading to a more flat shape (spring equilibrium state). With similar reasoning, we can observe that an increased ks seems to be making the cloth “flatten” more quickly as the spring forces are greater, instead of scrunching up and then slowly getting to a resting state in the example with a lower spring constant.

</a>

<blockquote><b>
  Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
</b></blockquote>

<p>
  A shader program takes different parts on objects, like cloths and spheres, and through a variety of methods, including shading equations from various light sources and calling reference textures, determines what color this point on the object should be. We begin with a vertex shader, which considers reference points on each object and can manipulate their positions. Then, we afterwards go through a fragment shader, which actually decides the color that each portion of the object should be. It is through the combination of these processes by which we know where and what color certain objects are.
</p>

  Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words.
  Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
</b></blockquote>

<p>
  The Blinn-Phong shading model considers a combination of diffuse lighting as well as more reflective lighting that considers the half angle between the light source to object and camera to object vectors. In this particular example, we start by giving each point a tad bit of lighting. Then, for every point on the object, we consider its normal vector, and then shade it in accordance with the dot product of this with the light vector and this half-angle vector, with both values scaled by constants and by the inverse of the squared distance afterwards. There is one other interesting aspect of the Blinn-Phong model, which is that, if the value is nonnegative, we take dot(n,h) to a large exponent p, which we chose in our particular case to be 100. This way, we really separate our half-angles that are not that close to normal to the object.

<p>
  Bump shading and displacement shading have the same underlying fragment shader but different vertex shaders. They both take a texture and act like changes in color on the image reflect a difference in surface normal. However, displacement shading takes this a step further and genuinely also changes the vertex positions of each object in accordance with the textures. Therefore, both of them at least vaguely have shading that emulates the image, in a sense, but displacement matching also changes the locations of the portions of the sphere and cloth (and indeed the surface normal), before undergoing the same fragment shader, which further alters the surface normal before calculating the shading.

<p>
  We decided to be a bit creative and try to let the time affect the color! In order to accomplish this, we added an extra attribute in ClothSimulator::drawPhong for the time in seconds modulo 10, Then, we multiply the rgb values by different values depending on the current internal clock time in order to get a colored tint on our objects. This way, now the cloth kind of flickers sort of like Christmas lights. To see this, please visit our website at https://antoniomacaronio.github.io/proj-webpage-template/proj4/index.html to see the animation of our shader!

  Anthony worked on all the tasks 1-4 and the writeup for them.
  Andrew worked on task 5 and the extra credit. Together, we spent a lot of time brainstorming how to approach the project, and worked together on the html and writing up all the images.
